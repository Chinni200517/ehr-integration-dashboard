Subject: EHR Integration Dashboard — Submission

Hi [Recipient Name],

Please find attached the final deliverable for the EHR Integration Dashboard assignment.
I have included:
- A Next.js TypeScript starter scaffold (server-side proxy + client hooks)
- Implementation guide and API discovery document
- Postman collection and example unit tests

Download the ZIP here: [ATTACH ZIP OR INSERT LINK]

Notes:
- Replace placeholders in `.env.example` with your DrChrono/Epic credentials.
- The project uses a proxy pattern—serverless API routes attach access tokens securely.

Thanks,
Chinni Krishna
